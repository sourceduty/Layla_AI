Layla is an excellent AI assistant designed to operate entirely offline, ensuring unmatched privacy and secure interactions. Unlike cloud-based systems, Layla processes all data locally on your device, eliminating concerns about data breaches or unauthorized access. This makes it an ideal choice for users prioritizing confidentiality while enjoying the benefits of AI-driven interactions. The app supports diverse conversational styles and personalities, adapting to user preferences over time for a highly personalized experience.

One of Layla's standout features is its ability to load local .gguf files, allowing users to utilize custom or specialized language models directly on their devices. This functionality enables advanced users to experiment with or deploy specific models tailored to their needs, expanding Layla's utility beyond standard AI applications. By running entirely offline, Layla offers a private, flexible, and powerful platform for engaging with AI, all while ensuring that data never leaves the user's control.
